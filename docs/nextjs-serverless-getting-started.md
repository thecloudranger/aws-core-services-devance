# Getting Started

Before we begin, make sure you have the following:

- Node.js v10.x or later  installed
- A valid and confirmed AWS account

We will be working from a terminal using a [Bash shell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bash_(Unix_shell)) to run commands to create the project and deploy to AWS.

While some level of React is helpful, this workshop requires zero previous knowledge about React.

To get started, we first need to create a new Serverless project.

```bash
$ npx serverless create --template aws-nodejs
```

Open the project folder in your favourite IDE.
